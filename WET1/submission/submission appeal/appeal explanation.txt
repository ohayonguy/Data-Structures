All of the changes can be seen by searching for 'DELETED' in the code.
The changes are:
1) in dict_avl.h, line 7, deleted the line for #define NDEBUG.
	defining NDEBUG caused the compiler to report a warning becuase the compilation line already contained -DNDEBUG.
2) in dict_avl.h, line 11, deleted #include <vector> which is not really used in our code.
3) in dict_avl.h, line 10, deleted #include <algorithm> which is not used in our code.
	both of these are modules that we did not use in our code. We only forgot to delete the "include" statements.
4) in image.h, line 172, replaced delete with delete[] in one line only.
	the algorithm itself remains the same, and the mistake did not cause any actual memory leaks or output differences:
	valgrind failed only because this is the wrong delete type.
